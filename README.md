# Python Neuroevolution Playground
Some older code of mine from 2019 that I used to experiment with evolutionary driven reinforcement learning.
The goal of this project was to build an understanding of the math behind neural networks and fitness based learning.

The project simply uses:
  - Pyglet
  - Numpy
  - and some magic

# The learning never ends, very much still a work in progress!

### Installation

Use venv to install python libraries.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Todos

 - **CODE REFACTOR!!**
 - Resolve graphical artifacts
 - Improve development tools (NN diagram)
 - Add Night Mode
